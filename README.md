# It's my first app on Angular.js

The purpose was not to create something really useful but to learn and practise basic concepts more deeply.
The app was based on steps of [official tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) but instead of just repeating the same code as in tutorial I decide to make app with other functionalities - simple task manager.

## Thus in my to-do app you can:

- add tasks
- edit title and description of the task
- mark task "done" or "undone" to arrange in different lists
- search tasks by title or description

## I learned and mastered how to:

 - decouple code using components and modules and organize code by feature area
 - use filters, create custom filters
 - use two and one-way data binding
 - use dependency injection even if js code will be minimized
 - set up routing and use multiple views
 - use services from the box and create custom services
 - write and run unit tests with Jasmin and Karma
